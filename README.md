Spree extension for [Mad Mimi](https://madmimi.com)
============

Mad Mimi's Spree extension allows you to easily import your product listings and buyer email addresses for a super efficient email integration.

Installation
------------

Add spree_madmimi to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_madmimi'
gem 'omniauth-madmimi', github: 'madmimi/omniauth-madmimi'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_madmimi:install
```

Get your Application ID and Secret from Mad Mimi:
* Visit [Mad Mimi applications](http://madmimi.com/oauth/applications).
* Click "New Application" button.
* For name use any string, e.g. "Spree Store".
* For redirect uri use your domain plus "/auth/madmimi/callback", e.g. "http://example.com/auth/madmimi/callback".

Add madmimi configuration to `config/application.rb` file:

```ruby
config.madmimi = {
  client_id:     '...your MadMimi Application ID...',
  client_secret: '...your MadMimi Secret...'
}
```

Replace Application ID and Secret placeholders with data that you got on the Mad Mimi website.


Configuration
-------------

Go to the admin section of your Spree store and visit: **Configurations &rarr; Mad Mimi**.

There you can connect your existing [Mad Mimi](https://madmimi.com) account or create a new one.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_madmimi/factories'
```
