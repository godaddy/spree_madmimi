============

Mad Mimi's Spree extension allows you to easily import your product listings and buyer email addresses for a super efficient email integration.

Installation
------------

Add spree_madmimi to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_madmimi'
gem 'omniauth-madmimi', github: 'madmimi/omniauth-madmimi'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_madmimi:install
```

Go to Mad Mimi website and create your OAuth application:
* Visit [OAuth applications](http://madmimi.com/oauth/applications) page.
* Click "New Application" button.
* Use any name you want, e.g. "Spree Store".
* And "/auth/madmimi/callback" path on your domain as redirect uri, e.g. "http://example.com/auth/madmimi/callback".

Add `initializers/mad_mimi.rb` file with contents:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :madmimi, '...your MadMimi Application ID...', '...your MadMimi Secret...'
end
```

Replace Application ID and Secret placeholders with data that you got on the Mad Mimi website.

Configuration
-------------

There you can connect your existing [Mad Mimi](https://madmimi.com) account or create a new one.

Testing
