============

Mad Mimi's Spree extension allows you to easily import your product listings and buyer email addresses for a super efficient email integration.

Installation
------------

Add spree_madmimi to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_madmimi'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_madmimi:install
```

Configuration
-------------

Go to the admin section of your Spree store and visit: **Configurations &rarr; Mad Mimi**.

There you can connect your existing [Mad Mimi](https://madmimi.com) account or create a new one.

Testing

```shell
bundle

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:
